    "Let's say you want to solve such an ODE over the domain $[a,b]$. For an initial value problem you need the value of $y$ and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ at the first point in the domain, $a$.\n",

    "$\\large y(a) = A~~~$ and $~~~\\large \\frac{dy}{dx}\\rvert_{x=a} = B$\n",

    "What we do now is transform the 2nd order ODE into two first order ODEs as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "First define, $w$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large w = \\frac{dy}{dx}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So that now the original equation can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\large \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}$\n",
